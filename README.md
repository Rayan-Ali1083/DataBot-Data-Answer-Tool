# DataBot-Data-Answer-Tool
Developed a RAG based LLM to anwswer queries about data science mentioned in book "Practical Statistics for Data Scientists".
- We used Chroma as vector database to store the embedding of the book and later use in app.
- We used  Gemini API for access the LLM.
- We used streamlit to deploy the model locally.
